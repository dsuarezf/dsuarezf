### Hi there 👋

<!--
**dsuarezf/dsuarezf** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

My name is David Suárez Fuentes and this is my GitHub public profile built from my own repository.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on products related to AI and specifically in the field of Natural Language Processing
- 🌱 I am a continous learner and I’m currently learning different topics, from latest trends in DevOps to transfer learning for NLP
- I also contribute to Opendaylight as a committer in several projects, although I must admit not too much lately :(
