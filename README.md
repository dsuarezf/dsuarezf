### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**dsuarezf/dsuarezf** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. -->

Welcome to my GitHub public profile, here I have some public repositories regarding DevOps, containers, micro-services, K8s and AI, as well as my blog.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™ve been working on products related to AI and specifically in the field of Natural Language Processing
- ðŸŒ± I am a continuous learner and Iâ€™m currently learning different topics, from latest trends in DevOps to transfer learning for NLP
- I also contribute to Opendaylight as a committer in several projects, although I must admit not too much lately :(
